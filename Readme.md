## Pricing UI

This is a simple react.js UI with an express.js backend to create a quote from dynamic line items.

This app is kinda broken in a few ways! The interview will be conducted in a call with several prompts 
for you to fix bugs and add small features. You should have this running beforehand on you local development environment
and able to write code in your editor of choice. 

Feel free to play around with the app on your own in preparation! 

### Local Setup
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` to start the dev server
- go to http://localhost:3000/
- express routes live at http://localhost:3000/{routeName} (eg: http://localhost:3000/hello)
